{"name":"ProjecturEd","tagline":"ProjecturEd is a generic purpose projectional editor.","body":"![My image](http://s9.postimage.org/mxnmsv4en/projectured.png)\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nProjecturEd is a generic purpose projectional editor written in Common Lisp. It supports editing multiple domains represented in arbitrary data structures. It also supports multiple bidirectional projections providing different notations varying from textual to graphics.\r\n\r\nJoin Us\r\n-------\r\n\r\nUnfortunately due to lack of time ProjecturEd is under quite *slow* construction. Send us a mail at projectured@gmail.com if you would like to participate.\r\n\r\nInternals\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThere's a [wiki](https://github.com/projectured/projectured/wiki) that might help getting an overview of the whole idea. If you are also interested in the internals, then currently the best thing to do is to look at the code. Surprisingly the code is not that long, it's less than 10,000 lines as of february, 2013. You may also read the files in the documentation folder of the repository, although it's far from being well structured. \r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nIf you just want to take a look at ProjecturEd in action, then there's a separate page in the [wiki](https://github.com/projectured/projectured/wiki/Screenshots) with a couple of screenshots showing various domains and projections.\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nUnfortunately performance is just not that good right now, although there are a few low hanging fruits in the code. The design also helps future improvements, because the printer and the reader are purely functional algorithms, so it wouldn't be that hard to utilize multiple cores for them. Finally, both the printer and the reader are written using a constraint based change propagation library that allows lazy and incremental computation of results. One day it might even be fast enough to be useful...\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe editor is far from being usable in the real world at the moment, don't expect too much right now. You have been warned!\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n[BSD License](https://github.com/projectured/projectured/wiki/License)\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
