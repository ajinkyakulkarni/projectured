 - split selection path and store only relevant parts on individual documents
 - avoid cloning tree nodes (and similar) just for indentation/coloring/etc purposes
 - fix navigation in common lisp references, it's broken due to recent selection split
 - change context sensitive help to display available but inaccessible commands too
 - make context sensitive help less fragile wrt. how operations are computed
 - implement key seqeuence gestures, add key gesture prefix parameters to projections
 - rename projections to <name>@<source-type>-><destination-type>? (e.g. syntax@json/array->tree/node)
 - add workbench editor/navigator/console parts
 - searching/search->graphics/canvas projection is plain wrong
